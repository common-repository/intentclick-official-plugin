INTENTclick Official Plug-in allows WordPress site owners to quickly install the INTENTclick tag on their entire site or selected categories.

== Description ==

INTENTclick was created exclusively for sites who have content about saving money or making a better income to help them achieve higher monetization levels using advanced targeting and optimization technologies developed by Kontera. The network offers a unique pricing model called performance RPC (Revenue Per Click) ) that guarantees a high minimum per click for U.S. users, in addition to providing commission sized compensation to affiliates on clicks that convert to sales.

INTENTclick is powered by Kontera Technologies' advanced targeting and optimization technologies, yet is distinct from Kontera brand advertising, in its focus on the needs of Direct Response advertisers and publishers. 

The ads you will get with INTENTclick are provided by highly qualified advertisers that we handpick to meet the content in the save money and better income verticals. We require our advertisers to be in an 'always on' mode so we can guarantee stable revenue to our publishers.

The wordpress plug-in is the easiest way to get started with INTENTclick. The plug-in is compatible with Google Adsense ads and most bloggers often finds that using both on the same blog will give them the best results.

= INTENTclick ads are not appearing on my site =

It can take up to 24 hours from the moment you have added the INTENTclick tag to your pages until the tag goes live.
If 24 hours have passed, make sure that our tag appears on your pages. To check this, review the HTML code for your pages by right-clicking your mouse and select 'view page source' for Firefox or 'view source' for IE. Next, by using the 'find' functionality of the page with HTML code (Ctrl+F), type the word 'INTENTclick'. You should see the INTENTclick tag right before the closing body tag (</body), at the very bottom of the HTML code.

If you do not see our tag in your HTML code, that will explain why are not seeing INTENTclick ads on your pages. Please check the configuration of your plugin to make sure you haven't blocked out any sections.

If you see our INTENTclick tag on your pages, please check the content of the page. Advertisers are reluctant to have their messages on pages about war, violence and other non-positive subjects, and these pages may be activating our filters. These filters work on a page-by-page basis, so if you think this may be an issue, look at pages that do not contain sensitive content.

If you are still unable to determine why no INTENTclick ads are showing up, please email us at support@intentclick.com and we will be glad to pinpoint the solution for you.

= Changing my payment details =

Through the 'My Account' tab you can change your payment method, update your account and tax information.

INTENTclick supports Check, ACH, Wire and Paypal with a minimum of $50 balance for issuing a payment.

Any changes you make will be immediately updated in our system, but please note that in order to take effect for the next billing cycle, updates must be submitted by the 15th of the month.

= Blocking a specific advertisement =

Please email us at support@intentclick.com specifying which advertiser you would like us to block. Please include the URL that the ad leads to in order to help us identify it, as well as the name of your site on which the ad was displayed. Our Support Team will handle your request within 3 business days.

= Will INTENTclick conflict with AdSense technically? =

INTENTclick is using Kontera technology which is implemented in over 15,000 websites many of which are using Adsense and there have been no technical issues with that.

= Will INTENTclick reduce my AdSense revenues? =

We have many sites who A/B tested the option of running only AdSense or running both and they all reached a conclusion that they make more money with both. When implementing the INTENTclick tag, you can determine what parts of the website will be available for INTENTclick to add text links. You can exclude the Adsense areas and even implement INTENTclick in a way that will guarantee some space between the two.
