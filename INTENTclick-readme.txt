1) copy the folder INTENTclick into wp-content/plugins in your wordpress installation.
2) On your wordpress administration pages, navigate to 'Plugins' and hit Activate next to the 'INTENTclick text links' plugin entry.
3) Still in the administration pages, navigate to the 'Setting' page, and choose the newly created submenu 'INTENTclick Settings'.
   You can select category names (separated by commas) where the INTENTclick text links code should not be used (and thus hide the text links). This option is referred as 'Block text links from categories'. Category names are case insensitive.
